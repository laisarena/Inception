## Docker Compose

- tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
- use a YAML file to configure applicationâ€™s services
- Create and start all the services with a single command

The features of Compose that make it effective are:
- Multiple isolated environments on a single host
- Preserve volume data when containers are created
- Only recreate containers that have changed
- Variables and moving a composition between environments
